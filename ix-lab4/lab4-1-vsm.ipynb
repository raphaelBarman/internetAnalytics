      "{'name': 'Image Processing for Life Science', 'description': 'This course intends to teach image processing with a strong emphasis of applications in life sciences. The idea is to enable the participants to solve image processing questions via workflows independently. Content Over the last decades, the images arising from microscopes in Life Sciences went from being a qualitative support of scientific evidence to a quantitative resource. To obtain good quality data from digital images, be it from a photograph of a Western blot, a TEM slice or a multi-channel confocal time-lapse stack, scientists must understand the underlying processes leading to the extracted information. Of similar importance is the software used to obtain the data. This course makes use of the ImageJ (FIJI package) as well as other open-source tools to ensure maximum reproducibility and protocol transfer of the analysis pipelines. The course will span 14 weeks with 1h30 of lecture per week, as well as exercises to complete outside of the course and will enable to students to establish image analysis workflows autonomously. Note This course is open to max. 16 students selected by the organizer. This 14-week course aims to introduce students to digital image analysis in the context of life sciences. We will cover the following topics:- Digital image data representations, formats, metadata- Image manipulation- Macro and script creation- Filtering, linear, non-linear, morphological- Segmentation- Regions of interest- Image stitching- Image visualisation- Data extraction and representation- Image deconvolution and denoising- Machine learning Each topic will have a strong emphasis on good practices and will be followed by exercises to be handed out at the next session. Exercises will involve the creation of macros or scripts to reach a defined goal. The exercises are to be completed as autonomous homework, outside of lecture hours.

       "  'description': 'This course intends to teach image processing with a strong emphasis of applications in life sciences. The idea is to enable the participants to solve image processing questions via workflows independently. Content Over the last decades, the images arising from microscopes in Life Sciences went from being a qualitative support of scientific evidence to a quantitative resource. To obtain good quality data from digital images, be it from a photograph of a Western blot, a TEM slice or a multi-channel confocal time-lapse stack, scientists must understand the underlying processes leading to the extracted information. Of similar importance is the software used to obtain the data. This course makes use of the ImageJ (FIJI package) as well as other open-source tools to ensure maximum reproducibility and protocol transfer of the analysis pipelines. The course will span 14 weeks with 1h30 of lecture per week, as well as exercises to complete outside of the course and will enable to students to establish image analysis workflows autonomously. Note This course is open to max. 16 students selected by the organizer. This 14-week course aims to introduce students to digital image analysis in the context of life sciences. We will cover the following topics:- Digital image data representations, formats, metadata- Image manipulation- Macro and script creation- Filtering, linear, non-linear, morphological- Segmentation- Regions of interest- Image stitching- Image visualisation- Data extraction and representation- Image deconvolution and denoising- Machine learning Each topic will have a strong emphasis on good practices and will be followed by exercises to be handed out at the next session. Exercises will involve the creation of macros or scripts to reach a defined goal. The exercises are to be completed as autonomous homework, outside of lecture hours.

Teaching methods The course is organized in lectures, class discussions and presentation of case studies. Lectures will provide the theoretical knowledge needed to understand global economic events. Students will have the opportunity to test their knowledge by doing weekly problem sets, which will be graded. Lectures will include several class discussions of recent economic events, which will allow students to apply the theory learned in class. Students will be divided in groups to work on a case study, which they will present in class. The topic of the case study varies from year to year and it will be chosen a few weeks into the course. The case study and its presentation will be part of the final grade. Expected student activities PROBLEM SETS Problem sets will begiven out each Monday and need to be returned to the instructor at the beginning of class the following Monday. The solution to the problem set will be available on the class web page. No late problem set will be accepted. All questions in the problem set will be graded. While working with other students on problem sets is allowed, each student must complete his/her problem set. I strongly recommend you to do the problem sets: this is the best way to learn the material and do well in the course. GROUP CASE STUDY Students will be divided in groups. Each group will prepare and present a case study that is typically related to current economic events. For example, last year the main topic was the Eurozone crisis and each group was assigned a specific topic related to it. The topic of your case study will be announced a few weeks into the course. The case studies will be presented in class and followed by general discussion. You will be graded on the quality of the material, the presentation, and the contribution to the class discussion of other groups' case studies.

Details are given for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and the Discrete Element Method (DEM). Content Particle-based computational methods are being increasingly employed for solving a variety of problems in engineering and applied science. While such Lagrangian methods can yield significant advantages compared to traditional mesh-based methods, their accurate and efficient implementation also provides a number of challenges. This course presents the fundamental aspects of two methods: Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is used to resolve partial differential equations, generally for convection-dominated fluid flows, and is based on the interpolation of field quantities around discrete points that are free to move in space. Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used for simulating granular and particulate flows and tracks particle motions and detects and models collisions between particles and with their environment. The course provides an introduction to these two methods and their domains of application (e.g. fluid and solid mechanics, computer graphics). The theoretical basis of each method, including specific aspects such as parallelization and visualization, is presented in introductory lectures. Following a literature search and private study, students give oral presentations on more advanced aspects.

Content Lausanne's urbanity is determined by a succession and overlap of single urban fragments. The individual character of these pieces provides the richness of its urban texture. This semester we will work on such an urban fragment. Avenue de la Sallaz and the possibility of its urban development is the theme of this semester. Each group will design a large urban housing building. We will work on the urban setting, the plans and the façades at the same time. The architecture of the Italian Renaissance is an architecture consisting of incomplete individual buildings and magnificent urban fragments. The artistic return to antiquity was above all a creative act set against a background of only fragmentary knowledge. Often with modest means, the master-builders of the Renaissance created works that have still not lost their expressive power today. The Renaissance buildings that appeal to us draw their power from the tension and resistance intrinsic to works that equally admit ideal and reality, imagination and contradiction, recklessness and conformism. This semester we will design buildings in this spirit. We will look simoultanously at buildings from the Renaissance and from today. The richness of architecture is the theme of the semester. Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Develop a design of an urban apartment building based on a pair of architectural references given by the professors, including highly articulate facades and floor plans that possess a spatial structure that reflects the urban condition.Represent their designs in large-scale working models of the buildingâ\\x80\\x99s exterior and interior, through model photography and in conventional architectural drawings.Discuss their project ideas in terms of gestalt, expression, interior spatial structure and in relationship to the transformation of the architectural references.Reflect on their design experience within the wider cultural context of the semester.

       "  'description': 'This studio explores meaningful form generating processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools and introduces the notion of growth typologies in architectural and urban design thinking. Our studio site will be in Singapore, our programme the procedural design of a vibrant innovation park. Content The advent of new digital technologies has had a twofold impact on architectural thinking and urban design, transforming, on one hand, the processes for form generation and design production through algorithmic and parametric technologies, and, on the other hand, enabling an escape from the static fate of the built environment by facilitating dynamic interaction between inhabitants and their surrounding. Our interest in the orientation \\'Artificial Morphogenesis\\' is to explore meaningful form generating processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools and introduce the notion of growth typologies in architectural and urban design thinking. In particular, we examine the potential of responsive morphogenetic design to explore intuitive form finding processes that address bio-climatic and socio-economic challenges.\\xa0 This studio (the \"Singapore studio\") is the first in a planned series of design research projects focused on the theme of data-driven urbanism. While developing a base of digital evidence specific to each site, each studio will explore novel means of deploying this data to support design and generate form. The intellectual aim of the studio is to question the extent to which the data-scape can artificially generate urban form. Our interest is directed at the decoding and recoding of two distinct domains of knowledge: exteriority which represents a many-layered geographic condition and anteriority which represents the embedded knowledge of local architectural typologies and systems. While the exteriority of geographic data is crucial to our research, we place a primary emphasis on the generative potential of typology- what we have called \"growth typologies\". Decoding anterior form and then recoding and deploying it across new territories allows us to challenge the role of architecture in urban developments of increased scale and complexity. Keywords Data-driven Design Computational Urbanism Morphogenesis Artificial Design Rapid Urbanization Singapore Equatorial Urbanism. Learning Prerequisites Important concepts to start the course (1) Parametric Methods: In alignment with the goals of the morphogenesis orientation, this studio will explore meaningful form generating processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools and introduce the notion of growth typologies in architectural and urban design thinking. (2) Digital Generative Design Tools:\\xa0 We assert that it is precisely the new wave of digital tools (scripting, parametric modeling, and associative geometry) that enable the type of approach which is forwarded by the studio\\'s agenda. The ability to organize and leverage information permits the architect to approach projects of new scales and complexity. The logical management of variation allows the architect to avoid repetitive solutions and to maintain an equally high level of conceptual rigor across the entire project, to engage with that complexity rather than reducing it. An additional aspect is the ability to quickly and accurately produce quantitative information during the design process which can be used to strengthen the argument or inform the decision-making process. Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Interpret the morphogenetic parameters and other issues of relevance to the project using drawings and diagrams.Critique a specific project brief and a specific context and respond with a meaningful data-driven design concept.Translate a data-driven design concept into meaningful architectural and/or urban propositions at appropriate scales and levels of granularity.Produce coherent architectural representations and models at sufficient levels of detail.Formulate the morphogenetic narrative and create convincing arguments for the design propositions.Develop convincing final diagrams, drawings, renderings, simulations, physical and digital models. Transversal skills Collect data.Design and present a poster.Make an oral presentation. Teaching methods The studio is project based, and will use design research methods and design studio pedagogy, ordinarily consisting of desk critiques, pin-up reviews, intermediate and final reviews.\\xa0 The studio is committed to the transformative power and relevance of architectural form to the life of the city. That being the case, we are not enforcing a formal agenda; rather, our desire is to empower architects in their form-finding capability.\\xa0 Digital tool is not an end of itself but a means for exploring alternative and novel, yet sensible and meaningful architectures. \\xa0 Expected student activities Architectural projects will be developed individually (or exceptionally in groups of 2).\\xa0 Some group work may occur in the analysis stages.\\xa0 \\xa0 Assessment methods Grading will be based upon the quality of the projects in the research exercises, in the intermediary reviews and in the final review.\\xa0 Projects will be reviewed and assessed based on their conceptual strength and innovation, the coherence and resolution of their architectural translation, their representative clarity and expressive power, and the persuasiveness of their communication, both orally, and through the physical and digital artifacts.\\xa0 \\xa0 Supervision Assistants Yes',\n",

       "  'description': 'The workshop provides second year students with the opportunity to apply theoretical structural principles in an applied context through the collaborative design of a concrete formwork that tests structural and material limits. Content The workshop will: 1. explore a structural theory through applied investigation; 2. use reiterative testing and design to develop an idea; 3. explore the limits of materiality and dimensioning such that design failure can be learned from; 4. and challenge students to collaborate in diverse intellectual, creative and hands-on situations across disciplinary backgrounds. Building on the \"Cantilever: making structural logic\" workshops that took place over the past two years, this year the research will move from working with wood, to studying concrete, allowing the workshop to build links to the Unité d\\'Enseignement Argamassa Armada, that looks at the reinforced concrete research of the Brazilian architect João Filgueiras Lima (known as Lélé). Through this overlapping with the UE, the Semaine ENAC will provide students with a context to the applied research that they are themselves undertaking. The objective of the week will be for students to design a concrete element that has a minimal dimension, where the element\\'s fragile formwork tests the limits of a reinforced concrete system. The second year ENAC program marks a moment when theoretical learning is confronted by constraints inherent in applied research. The Semaine ENAC has an important potential to address this shift and the larger objective of the current proposal is to provide students with the tools to take part in such a dynamic. Teaching methods Working at 1:1 scale will require students to use drawing, model, calculation and collaborative investigations to design prototypes, details and a successful scheme. Testing sessions throughout the week and the students\\' documentation of this testing, will push designs to failure and lead to a reconsideration and redesign of the proposal. Expected student activities 1. Drawing across disciplines (1-hour lecture). This lecture will look at the ways drawing has been used as a tool for research and design by architects and engineers throughout history and at different scales of investigation. The distinctions between sketch, hard-line and diagrammatic drawings will be developed through historical and contemporary examples. The role that drawing plays as a tool for interdisciplinary communication will also be examined and students will be encouraged to develop their projects using different forms of drawing as a primary means of research. 2. Knowledge production (1-hour lecture). This lecture will look at different theoretical approaches to thinking about knowledge, both in terms of how it is generated and how it can be categorized or distinguished. The discussion is relevant for the interdisciplinary context of the workshop in the way it asks questions about distinctions between applied and theoretical research. For example, the relations between episteme/techne, between mimesis/poieisis, between inductive/deductive reasoning, provide a theoretical framework for the students to understand research through making. 3. Material investigations : wood, concrete, steel (1 hour lecture/visit). This module looks at the behavioral properties of different materials and is structured around visits to material-testing laboratories on the EPFL campus. 4. Lélé (Argamassa Armada): (1 hour lecture). This exchange will introduce Semaine ENAC students to the research being conducted in the Argamassa Armada Unité d\\'Enseignement and will comprise: a. A short introduction to the work of Lélé and the system of reinforced concrete that he developed in Brazil. b. Presentations by 3rd year UE students. This direct, vertical exchange between disciplines and between years of study, led by the students themselves, we hope can nurture an engagement and responsibility towards the collective research that is being undertaken between the two interdisciplinary modules. 5. Fabrication (6, 4-hour collaborative blocks). In this final module, students will work in interdisciplinary teams to develop a concrete form-work that pushes material limits. The module will be introduced at the beginning of the week with students working each day to design and fabricate a proposal. The theoretical inputs received from points 1, 2, 3 and 4 will inform the decisions and design. Modules 1-4 provide an interdisciplinary framework for the workshop that opens paths for future questioning. They are essential to the success of the week and provide a context and spirit for the investigation. Nevertheless, the 1:1 fabrication will occupy the largest part of the students\\' time and energy: in bringing together students from the different ENAC schools, this opportunity to design, calculate and build a 1:1 structure offers a unique chance to directly experience ways of thinking, working together, and making. The human exchanges engendered by the project could test the disciplinary boundaries that sometimes prevent students from exploring -- on both a personal and intellectual level \\' the other sections within the school. The 1:1 fabrication also confronts students with the power of scientific discovery through the observation of nature; forces, materials, behavior and failure become a direct vehicle for learning.',\n",

Due to the scale and character of today's territorial expansion, the definition of the urban becomes more diffuse and complex. laba's didactic method takes students through design scales ranging from the territorial to the architectural in a year long course. Content The Middle East was the birthplace of the Neolithic Revolution, the founding agricultural act that came to humanize and domesticate the planet. Bridging between Africa and Eurasia and pervaded by large rivers and marshlands, it contained a comparatively moist and fertile land. While climate changes during the Ice Age led to repeated extinction events, this region retained a greater amount of biodiversity than either Europe or North Africa, making it a crucial link in the distribution of Old World flora and fauna, including the spread of humanity. It is considered the Cradle of Civilization because it saw some of the very first developments in human social and technological inventions such as cities, class-based societies, monumental architecture, writing, the wheel, and irrigation. It was home to the eight Neolithic founder crops and four species of domesticated animals (cows, goats, sheep, and pigs). Aslo known as the Fertile Crescent, this region saw the onset of the human domination of nature and the birth of a long history of pastoral aesthetics. laba Studio 2016/17 will focus on Israel and the role played by agriculture in: 1) territorial appropriation and domestication; 2) structuring the development of urbanization; 3) creating a national homeland narrative; and 4) changing the climate. We will look into the three major types of Israeli agricultural development: the vernacular Palestinian/Bedouin, the socialist utopian Kibbutz/ Moshav, and the high-tech desert farming.The studio will be carried out in collaboration with Landbasics, a landscape architecture Master studio at the Technion headed by Prof. Matanya Sack. \\xa0 Keywords Israel, agriculture, arcadia, utopia, colonialism, settlement, water, food.

       "  'description': \"Key competence for architects is the ability to represent ideas and communicate a project's aims coherently. Therefore, the UE-N focuses on experimenting with artistic techniques for interpreting reality and transmitting ideas. Content Speculation & Artifact Perception, inspiration and imagination serve as essential cornerstones and starting points in every creative activity in design and architecture. We are nowadays experiencing profound changes and will be confronted in future with even more fundamental upheavals in the areas of technology, society and ecology. There will be no easy answers or tried and tested solutions to many of the challenges to be faced. Creativity, inventiveness und mental agility will be in high demand especially among the current and future generations of students and trainees. Creativity is nurtured by a mentally agile, playful, sometimes near naive approach. This mental act, not always logical, mostly driven by intuition, is also of paramount importance for our continued existence because ' in an environment characterized by rationally operating computers and machines ' it is this non-rational and elusive tactic that will offer and secure an irreplaceable place for us humans in future. The module will focus on working with experimental and visual compositional techniques. The main interest lies in the visual connecting and rearranging of what is seemingly incompatible, image constructions that have very little to do with reality, utopia in terms of content, composed however in terms of visual vocabulary mostly as photographs, thus apparently very plausible and realizable. With the 3D and rendering programme Cinema 4D, students will develop a compelling series of images, ranging from abstract two-dimensional image compositions to figurative, fictitious and speculative arrangements of objects. On their computers, and with a series of progressive exercises, participants will develop a series of unconventional image compositions. These, in a first phase, are based on the arrangement of colour, surface and basic body, and in the second phase, the compositions use found components and those drawn from 3D libraries. In this context, work examples from the genres of abstract art, still life and assemblage are used as reference. The course encourages the use of digital instruments in engaging at the very extreme limit of the interplay between reality and fiction. Keywords Experimental and visual compositional techniques, rearranging, idea and representation, the real and the imaginary, the object and its image, architectural expression, figurative digital tools, digital image techniques, photography, image montage, rendering. Learning Prerequisites Required courses Basic knowledge of techniques of image editing and 3D modelling. Laptop to work with during the course days. Cinema 4D software installed on computer. Basic knowledge of English. Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Investigate and interpret the visual environment.Enhance visual faculties of perception and expression.Describe visual principles of photorealistic images.Specify the possibilities and potential afforded by digital image techniques.Simulate and reconstruct a fragment of built reality by means of digital image techniques.Formulate a personal creative process.Develop and apply conceptual pictorial approaches.Translate an imaginary vision into a realistic visual compound by means of figurative digital tools.Select and use image strategies best suited to the transmission of an architectural idea.Produce computer-generated images. Teaching methods Lectures, workshops, practical work (individual): intermediate exercises and final work, desk critiques. Expected student activities Strong interest in (digital) image processing techniques. Mandatory and attentive attendance during all of the course days.

       "  'description': \"Key competences for every architect are the ability to represent ideas coherently and communicate a project's aims effectively. Design, painting, photography, modelling and graphics are essential to the architectural project and become didactic instruments for the development of individual talent. Content Compounds - words and images Perception, inspiration and imagination serve as essential cornerstones and starting points in every creative activity in design and architecture. Creativity does not simply flow from nothingness; rather, it needs an archive ' be that the mind or a sketch book ' from where it draws inspiration, re-arranges and composes. Architects, in their quest for a design, undoubtedly turn first and foremost to the graphic form:\\xa0 fragments, images or set pieces therefrom, seen or internalized, which are then arranged into novel relationships. These design components consist for the most part of graphic signs that refer to and/or reflect reality linguistically, either in an apparently real or in an abstract way. But these graphic components originate mostly in our visual environment. The topic of the current course builds on the insight that language and its syntax may also serve as an approach to creative design.\\xa0 The course's starting point, borrowed from linguistics, is the possibility of combining individual words into a new compound word, the meaning of which may differ from the meaning of each of its parts. This type of word formation, called compounding, is a salient feature in particular of the German language. The number of possible word combinations, especially of noun compounds, is sheer endless. The English language, to a lesser extent, also allows this type of word formation. Thus it will be used an experimental approach to design.\\xa0 At the start of the course, the participants make up a series of compound nouns that do not correspond to any existing reality and have no fixed denotation (for example stair bed > stair-bed; sleep door > sleep-door). Next, these fictitious linguistic coinages are to be visually encapsulated and translated into seemingly real architectural objects, using the professional digital image techniques taught during the course. Keywords Idea and representation, the real and the imaginary, the object and its image, architectural expression, figurative digital tools, digital image techniques, photography, image montage, rendering. Learning Prerequisites Required courses -\\xa0\\xa0 basic knowledge of techniques of image editing and 3D-modelling-\\xa0\\xa0 laptop to work with during the course days.-\\xa0\\xa0 Photoshop (min.

Content Social and Cognitive Factors in Professional Learning General Aim: To enable participants to understand the ways in which professionals learn their profession, in the initial training stage, the induction into practice stage and the continuing professional development stage. General Description of Material:The ability for individuals and organisations to learn is often regarded as central to their survival and success in the contemporary world. But how do professionals (like teachers, or engineers) learn their profession? What are the differences between how we learn (a) in initial training, (b) during the transition into work and (c) when an experienced professional? Learning is partially a psychological concept, but professionals operate in social contexts and so an understanding of professional learning also draws on sociological research. Therefore understanding professional learning will involve a multi-disciplinary approach. Plan of the course:Through exploring a number of types of studies on different aspects of learning, participants will build an understanding of some different research approaches which are used in studying learning.

       "  'description': \"The Commons - part 2 will tackle the urgent issue of rebuilding the shared infrastructure of the European territory, with the periphery of Milan as its case-study. Content After a full year of research into\\xa0Metropolitan Architecture, this time\\xa0Architecture without Content\\xa0will tacklethe Commons. In the wake of Brexit and the current soul searching inside the European continent about both the amplitude of its territory and the essence of its shared culture, this issue appears even more urgent than ever. Of all possible cases we decided to focus our attention this year on Italy, because exactly there for a certain period of time\\xa0 public architecture has been a constitutional part of its civilization; i.e. the Roman machine. During a few centuries the standard urban infrastructure of any given Roman city (the theatre, the market, the agora, the baths, the temples, the basilica, the markets, the schools, the legion's headquarters and so forth) was in fact the essential spine of public life. This architecture thus allowed the very existence of the cities the way we got to know them. Since then,\\xa0the Commons\\xa0experienced ups and downs, were boosted by the pride of the city bourgeois in the Gothic cities, and were even carefully planned by the newly developed modern states. In the last century, both the totalitarian state and the welfare state, used\\xa0the Commons\\xa0to fulfill their own particular agenda thus producing the final incarnation of\\xa0the Commons\\xa0as a solid architectural apparatus for the cities. Since the eighties however, post Thatcher politics (i.e. the Empire) has been eroding\\xa0the Commons. Today,the Commons\\xa0we have left in our western society has a heavily transformed profile. In certain nations, as Italy, the phenomenon was particularly evident, as the investments on welfare had been drastically cut. No more social housing, no more schools, no more post offices, no more civic centers: the desert. In the far depths of the Even Covered Field, the suburban mall surreptitiously replaced some of the functions, as such becoming the only possible stage for twisted remnants of anything public.\\xa0 The reoccuring crisis of the current world-order asks urgently for a way out. Can architecture - common expression of power - enable such a rupture, or at least bring a contribution towards another equilibrium? We believe a possibility lays (again) in the formalization of\\xa0the Commons. This year we want to investigate if\\xa0the Commons\\xa0can still be made and how they can be effective again. We will design where the problem is more evident, in the endless extension of the Roman periphery, a nasty by-product of failed utopias and criminal real estate investments, and in the northern periphery of Milan where the planned city morphs into the informal accumulation of wildly individual choices. In Rome, during first semester, we will unfold a possible narrative following the lines of the Appia, a remarkable axis radiating from the city centre and pointing towards what is left of the Roman countryside. In the second semester we hope to repeate this 'trick' in Milan, using the Northern axis of Corso Sempione.\\xa0 In the tradition of the Modern, we will locate and design schools, post offices, civic centers, police stations and more, expecting to be surprised by the students even at the level of the program. Success is not guaranteed, but the stakes are too high to be ignored.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Keywords Form, difficult whole, the even covering of the field, Roman Architecture, Metropolitan Architecture, \\xa0condensed urbanity, territory, technological optimism, public architecture, the commons. \\xa0 Learning Prerequisites Required courses UE L : Art et architecture: construire l'image I (Philipp Schaerer).

They admit a parsimonious representation in a wavelet basis and are relevant to coding, compressed sensing, and biomedical imaging. Content Mastery of the continuous-domain theory of Gaussian and non-Gaussian stochastic processes and of the corresponding\\xa0 mathematical machinery: \\xa0- Generalized functions, (fractional) differential operators, Fourier multipliers, singular integrals \\xa0- Innovation models and operator-based resolution of linear stochastic differential equations \\xa0- Characteristic form, Lévy-Khinchine representation, functional link with splines, infinite divisibility and sparsity Representation and analysis of sparse stochastic processes: - Operator-like wavelets, decoupling using discrete operators, determination of transform-domain statistics Ability to design algorithms for the recovery of sparse signals with application to biomedical imaging: - Principled discretization of inverse problems, MAP and MMSE estimators - Specification of iterative linear reconstruction algorithms using proximal operators and efficient linear solvers \\xa0 Sparse stochastic processes are continuous-domain processes that admit a parsimonious representation in some matched wavelet-like basis. Such models are relevant to image compression, compressed sensing, and, more generally, to the derivation of statistical algorithms for solving ill-posed inverse problems. This course is devoted to the study of the broad family of sparse processes that are specified by a generic (non-Gaussian) innovation model or, equivalently, as solutions of linear stochastic differential equations driven by white Lévy noise. It presents the mathematical tools for their characterization. The two leading threads that underly the exposition are: ' the statistical property of infinite divisibility, which induces two distinct types of behavior'Gaussian vs. sparse'at the exclusion of any other ' the structural link between linear stochastic processes and spline functions which is exploited to simplify the mathematics The concepts are illustrated with the derivation of algorithms for the recovery of sparse signals, with applications to biomedical image reconstruction. In particular, this leads to a Bayesian reinterpretation of popular sparsity-promoting processing schemes'such as total-variation denoising, LASSO, and wavelet shrinkage'as MAP estimators for specific types of sparse processes. The formulation also suggests alternative recovery procedures that minimize the estimation error. The course is targeted to an audience of graduate students and researchers with an interest in signal/image processing, compressed sensing, approximation theory, machine learning, or statistics. \\xa0 For more details, including table of content, see http://www.sparseprocesses.org/ Keywords Signal and image processing, sparsity, stochastic modeling, wavelets, compressed sensing.

       "  'description': \"The Commons - part 1: Appia Novissima will tackle the urgent issue of rebuilding the shared infrastructure of the European territory, with the Roman periphery as its case-study. Content After a full year of research into Metropolitan Architecture, this time Architecture without Content will tackle the Commons. In the wake of Brexit and the current soul searching inside the European continent about both the amplitude of its territory and the essence of its shared culture, this issue appears even more urgent than ever. Of all possible cases we decided to focus our attention this year on Italy, because exactly there for a certain period of time\\xa0 public architecture has been a constitutional part of its civilization; i.e. the Roman machine. During a few centuries the standard urban infrastructure of any given Roman city (the theatre, the market, the agora, the baths, the temples, the basilica, the markets, the schools, the legion's headquarters and so forth) was in fact the essential spine of public life. This architecture thus allowed the very existence of the cities the way we got to know them. Since then, the Commons experienced ups and downs, were boosted by the pride of the city bourgeois in the Gothic cities, and were even carefully planned by the newly developed modern states. In the last century, both the totalitarian state and the welfare state, used the Commons to fulfill their own particular agenda thus producing the final incarnation of the Commons as a solid architectural apparatus for the cities. Since the eighties however, post Thatcher politics (i.e. the Empire) has been eroding the Commons. Today, the Commons we have left in our western society has a heavily transformed profile. In certain nations, as Italy, the phenomenon was particularly evident, as the investments on welfare had been drastically cut. No more social housing, no more schools, no more post offices, no more civic centers: the desert. In the far depths of the Even Covered Field, the suburban mall surreptitiously replaced some of the functions, as such becoming the only possible stage for twisted remnants of anything public.\\xa0 The reoccuring crisis of the current world-order asks urgently for a way out. Can architecture - common expression of power - enable such a rupture, or at least bring a contribution towards another equilibrium? We believe a possibility lays (again) in the formalization of the Commons. This year we want to investigate if the Commons can still be made and how they can be effective again. We will design where the problem is more evident, in the endless extension of the Roman periphery, a nasty by-product of failed utopias and criminal real estate investments, and in the northern periphery of Milan where the planned city morphs into the informal accumulation of wildly individual choices. In Rome, during first semester, we will unfold a possible narrative following the lines of the Appia, a remarkable axis radiating from the city centre and pointing towards what is left of the Roman countryside. In the second semester we hope to repeate this 'trick' in Milan, using the Northern axis of Corso Sempione.\\xa0 In the tradition of the Modern, we will locate and design schools, post offices, civic centers, police stations and more, expecting to be surprised by the students even at the level of the program. Success is not guaranteed, but the stakes are too high to be ignored. Keywords Form, difficult whole, the even covering of the field, Roman Architecture, Metropolitan Architecture, \\xa0condensed urbanity, territory, technological optimism, public architecture, the commons, Via Appia Learning Prerequisites Required courses UE L : Art et architecture: construire l'image I (Schaerer).

Content Context In the last decade, our information society has mutated into a data society, where the volume of worldwide data doubles every 1.5 years. How to make sense of such tremendous volume of data? Developing effective techniques to extract meaningful information from large-scale and high-dimensional dataset has become essential for the success of business, government and science. Objective The goal of this course is to provide a broad introduction to effective algorithms in data science and network analysis. A major effort will be given to show that existing data analysis techniques can be defined and enhanced on graphs. Graphs encode complex structures like cerebral connection, stock exchange, and social network. Strong mathematical tools have been developed based on linear and non-linear graph spectral harmonic analysis to advance the standard data analysis algorithms. Main topics of the course are networks, unsupervised and supervised learning, recommendation, visualization, sparse representation, multi-resolution analysis, neuron network, and large-scale computing. Structure The course is organized into two parts: lectures (2 hours) and coding exercises (1 hour). The essential objective of the exercises is to apply the theory on real-world cases.

       "  'description': \"laba's focal theme is Urban Nature. Due to the scale and character of today's territorial expansion, the definition of the urban becomes more diffuse and complex. laba's didactic method takes students through design scales ranging from the territorial to the architectural in a year long course. Content The Middle East was the birthplace of the Neolithic Revolution, the founding agricultural act that came to humanize and domesticate the planet. Bridging between Africa and Eurasia and pervaded by large rivers and marshlands, it contained a comparatively moist and fertile land. While climate changes during the Ice Age led to repeated extinction events, this region retained a greater amount of biodiversity than either Europe or North Africa, making it a crucial link in the distribution of Old World flora and fauna, including the spread of humanity. It is considered the Cradle of Civilization because it saw some of the very first developments in human social and technological inventions such as cities, class-based societies, monumental architecture, writing, the wheel, and irrigation. It was home to the eight Neolithic founder crops and four species of domesticated animals (cows, goats, sheep, and pigs). Aslo known as the Fertile Crescent, this region saw the onset of the human domination of nature and the birth of a long history of pastoral aesthetics. laba Studio 2016/17 will focus on Israel and the role played by agriculture in: 1) territorial appropriation and domestication; 2) structuring the development of urbanization; 3) creating a national homeland narrative; and 4) changing the climate. We will look into the three major types of Israeli agricultural development: the vernacular Palestinian/Bedouin, the socialist utopian Kibbutz/ Moshav, and the high-tech desert farming.The studio will be carried out in collaboration with Landbasics, a landscape architecture Master studio at the Technion headed by Prof. Matanya Sack. \\xa0 Keywords Israel, agriculture, arcadia, utopia, colonialism, settlement, water, food Learning Prerequisites Required courses Spring Semester at laba is a mandatory follow up to previous fall semester. laba takes yearly subscriptions only. Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Create and follow a project through the various design phases: feasibility study, schematic design, design development and presentation documentation.Conduct field research including the survey and documentation of a site.Present the project through various media: drawings, models, text descriptions, photography, as well as through oral presentations. Transversal skills Use a work methodology appropriate to the task.Continue to work through difficulties or initial failure to find optimal solutions.Manage priorities.Take feedback (critique) and respond in an appropriate manner.Make an oral presentation.Access and evaluate appropriate sources of information. Teaching methods In the Spring semester laba students must write their own project brief (site program spatial intention) that leads to the development of an architecture project based on the constitution carried out in the first semester. Each student is asked to critically appoint a site and program, and then the project design unfolds in a sequence similar to\\xa0the official phases: feasibility study, schematic design, design development, presentation documentation. Lectures on the subjects of structure, façade, building services, and fit-out provide inputs to each phase accordingly. This procedure can be seen as a dress rehearsal for the master thesis project.\\xa0Students work individually. Expected student activities The studio is located in Basel.

       "  'description': 'The school will cover the material synthesis, characterization and the applications in nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), high frequency electronics and quantum devices of 2-dimensional layered materials. Students will develope a model of a 2D nano-electromechanical system using COMSOL. Content The emergence of two-dimensional materials started by the experimental isolation of graphene, a single layer of graphite, by mechanical exfoliation in 2004. Since then, the research field of 2-dimensional layered materials not only has been launched but is also developing in an exponential manner, which could be seen in the number of related publications. Graphene and other 2-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), hexagonal boron nitride, phosphorene, etc. have been gaining tremendous attention in the field of material science, nano-electronics, photonics, and energy technology. 2D materials have a layered structure, consisting of few-atom-thick sheets stacked together and held by weak van der Waals forces which allows their isolation into single layers. The family of 2D layered materials offer a comprehensive library containing the metallic, insulating, semiconducting and superconducting properties which makes it possible to realize various electronic and optoelectronic device using building blocks all based on 2D materials and give rise to many new device concepts and theories. Graphene is a semimetal with excellent electronic and thermal conductivity. With its high transparency due to monolayer thickness, graphene would be one of the best candidates for transparent electrodes. Its peculiar band structure provides a platform to study various physical phenomenon, such as massless Dirac Fermion and anomalous room-temperature Hall effect, to be studied. Furthermore, despite being ultrathin, graphene offers excellent mechanical properties.\\xa0 Being the strongest material ever discovered, graphene has the breaking strength about 200 times higher than stainless steel and could sustain high elastic strain of up to 20%. The high stiffness and the high flexibility makes graphene a promising candidate for application in flexible electronics and nanoelectromechanical devices. \\xa0 \\xa0Semiconducting 2D materials such as TMDs are another groups of this family of materials that offer even more promising properties. Unlike graphene which is a semimetal and therefore unsuitable for digital electronics, these atomically thin layers poses a sizable bandgap which makes them highly suitable for building active electronic devices such as the basic unit\\xa0 of logic circuits and processors. The family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) fulfil the need for 2D layered semiconductors with a vast spectrum of properties. Nowadays, the essential role of these materials is more and more highlighted as the integrated circuit industry based on Si-MOSFET is approaching the limits of down-scaling, which has been used over decades to improve the processing power per unit area. 2D semiconducting TMDs are considered as a potential solution due to their ultrathin thickness, which allows efficient modulation of the carrier transport. Moreover, the direct bandgap of monolayer TMDs guarantee promising applications in optoelectronics, like light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors. Additionally, owing to the broken inversion symmetry of the crystalline structure of monolayer TMDs, the spin-valley coupling leads to the realization of novel spin-tronic and valley-tronic devices. \\xa0 \\xa0The topics of this summer school would cover a variety of 2D layered materials and their applications in electronic, optoelectronic, nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), flexible electronics, high frequency electronics, and quantum devices. The topics would range from theoretical calculations, material synthesis and characterization, to novel fabrication techniques and device performance analysis. \\xa0 The material synthesis methods such as mechanical exfoliation, liquid exfoliation and chemical vapour deposition, which are the most common ways to obtain high quality single to few layers 2D materials, would definitely be addressed. Since 2D materials represent the ultimate physical limit in thickness, nano-characterization is additionally important to correctly resolve and identify the properties of these materials. Therefore, a wide variety of material characterization tools and techniques such as atomic force microscopy, photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and their application in characterization of 2D materials would be demonstrated in the framework of this course. Specially, the application of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in characterization of ultrathin TMDs and the practical issue such as sample preparation techniques would be covered. \\xa0 \\xa0Additionally, deep insight into the experimental measurements and analysis of the data would be provided by the invited speakers. Applications in electronics and optoelectronics, such as field effect transistors, RF devices, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), LEDs, photodetectors, and photovoltaic devices, based on the combination of different 2D materials are also focus topics of our summer school. Research about theoretical calculations, which could predict and simulate the atomic structure, band structure, the effect of various defects and grain boundaries and performance of the devices would be discussed in order to make students understand the advantages and disadvantages of the commonly used calculation tools and obtain\\xa0 a picture of the material properties and device behaviour in an ideal case and in the presence of practical limitations such as crystalline defects and non-transparent contacts. \\xa0 Furthermore, the intriguing mechanical properties of 2D materials such as the extremely low areal mass, the generally high elastic modulus, high intrinsic strain and the coupling between their mechanical and electrical behaviour makes them highly interesting for realization of ultrathin NEMS. In the framework of this summer school, students would become familiar with the NEMS based on 2D materials. Additionally, by attending a hands on workshop, they would learn how to use finite element modelling to simulate the behaviour of NEMS based on 2D materials.

This course will focus on two major topics related to development: humanitarianism and public health. By humanitarianism, we refer to benevolent deeds undertaken beyond national frontiers on behalf of individuals, communities, groups or entire nations in dire straits by a variety of actors (i.e. organizations governmental and non-governmental associations, philanthropic foundations). The course will focus on humanitarian and public health's actors (non governmental organizations such as Médecins sans Frontière; international organizations; philanthropic organizations, for example the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). We will invite some of these actors and visit some of these institutions. We will also study these actors' tools, such as photography, movie, mass campaign vaccinations. We will pay attention to conflict and post conflict, imperial/colonial and post-colonial periods, during which development became a politically, economically, and socially relevant international issue. The course draws attention to the importance of historical perspectives, showing that global health or humanitarian operations are not inventions of the post-Cold War period but have a longer history.

       "  'description': 'This studio explores meaningful form generating processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools and introduces the notion of growth typologies. Our studio site will be in Singapore, our programme the procedural design of an innovation building prototypology. Content The advent of new digital technologies has had a twofold impact on architectural thinking and urban design, transforming, on one hand, the processes for form generation and design production through algorithmic and parametric technologies, and, on the other hand, enabling an escape from the static fate of the built environment by facilitating dynamic interaction between inhabitants and their surrounding. Our interest in the orientation \\'Artificial Morphogenesis\\' is to explore meaningful form generating processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools and introduce the notion of growth typologies in architectural and urban design thinking. In particular, we examine the potential of responsive morphogenetic design to explore intuitive form finding processes that address bio-climatic and socio-economic challenges. This studio (the \"Singapore studio\") is the second in a planned series of design research projects focused on the theme of data-driven architectural design. While developing a base of digital evidence specific to each site, each studio will explore novel means of deploying this data to support design and generate form. The intellectual aim of the studio is to question the extent to which the data-scape can artificially generate urban form. Our interest is directed at the decoding and recoding of two distinct domains of knowledge: exteriority which represents a many-layered geographic condition and anteriority which represents the embedded knowledge of local architectural typologies and systems. While the exteriority of geographic data is crucial to our research, we place a primary emphasis on the generative potential of typology- what we have called \"growth typologies\". Decoding anterior form and then recoding and deploying it across new territories allows us to challenge the role of architecture in urban developments of increased scale and complexity.\\xa0 \\xa0 Keywords \\' Data-driven Design \\' Parametricism \\' Morphogenesis \\' Artificial Design \\' Tropical Architecture \\' Singapore \\' Climate and Form\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Learning Prerequisites Required courses N/A Recommended courses AR-401(Y) Théorie et critique du projet MA1 (Huang). Important concepts to start the course (1) Parametric Methods: In alignment with the goals of the morphogenesis orientation, this studio will explore meaningful form generating processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools and introduce the notion of growth typologies in architectural and urban design thinking. (2) Digital Generative Design Tools: We assert that it is precisely the new wave of digital tools (scripting, parametric modeling, and associative geometry) that enable the type of approach which is forwarded by the studio\\'s agenda. The ability to organize and leverage information permits the architect to approach projects of new scales and complexity. The logical management of variation allows the architect to avoid repetitive solutions and to maintain an equally high level of conceptual rigor across the entire project, to engage with that complexity rather than reducing it. An additional aspect is the ability to quickly and accurately produce quantitative information during the design process which can be used to strengthen the argument or inform the decision-making process.\\xa0 \\xa0 Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Interpret the morphogenetic parameters and other issues of relevance to the project using drawings and diagrams.Critique a specific project brief and a specific context and respond with a meaningful data-driven design concept.Translate a data-driven design concept into meaningful architectural propositions at appropriate scales and levels of granularity.Produce coherent architectural representations and models at sufficient levels of detail.Formulate the morphogenetic narrative and create convincing arguments for the design propositions.Develop convincing final diagrams, drawings, renderings, simulations, physical and digital models.

       "  'description': \"The aim of the summer school is to bring fundamental knowledge of the main experimental tools and concepts in neurophysiology to the community of students working in neural engineering, neuroprosthetics or biomedical engineering fields Content These new and promising research fields are a melting pot of skilled researchers from different backgrounds ranging from biology to physics. This unique mixture of skills and personalities is required as these fields are at the interface between neuroscience and engineering. However, the daily rush to success, typical of modern PhDs, especially in the field of Bio'Neural Engineering, does not leave time to dig into the main neuro'scientific concepts and basic experimental tools. Questions like: ' how electromyographic signals are generated at the level of the nervemuscle junction? ' what is the source of Lead Field Potentials in the cortex? ' how this knowledge can be used in the design of better prostheses or robots? would need a proper and diligent investigation. Therefore we believe that a comprehensive course on what these concepts are and how they relate to engineering is of fundamental importance for a better informed use of state'of the art scientific concepts and tools. A summer school of basic science will also provide the time and the opportunity to develop new ideas that the deep knowledge of basic experimental neuroscience can provide to the attendees of the course, and therefore to the next generation of Neural and Biomedical Engineers. Structure of the summer school The summer school will be organized to have plenary speakers, providing the basic talks, and symposia speakers, presenting how basic neuroscience helps in their work.

The course is organised in three modules, seeking to cover the 'why', 'how', and 'how well' of STI policies. Content This course offers an introduction to science, technology and innovation (STI) policy. We understand: science policy as the area of public policy which is concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the science enterprise and the training of scientists (e.g., research grants and mobility programmes); technology policy as concerning the support, enhancement and development of technology (e.g., R&D tax credit and intellectual property rights); and innovation policy as concerning the actual implementation of technologies (e.g., commercialization and start-up support). The course is organised in three modules, seeking to cover the 'why', 'how', and 'how well' of STI policies. 1. Rationales for STI policy. Policies are financed with public (i.e., tax) money, and this module will explain the economic rationales for the state to support STI activities. It will explain that STI activities are subjects to a variety of market failures which require government intervention. 2. STI policy tools. There are various ways in which government can 'intervene' (i.e., spend money) to support STI activities, and this module will give an overview of the most common demand and supply-driven policy tools. 3. STI policy evaluation. Much like a medical doctor does on her own patients, the government does intervene to address fundamental failures in private agents' incentives'and ability'to conduct STI activities. However, government intervention in the field of STI policy is seldom evaluated. This module will discuss evaluation strategies and results.

The development kit proposed for hands\\'on labs will be presented during this first module of the course. The participants will get familiar with all the instruments that will be using during the following modules of the course. Then, this module will cover how to design complete ultra-low-power wearable platforms that can be powered with minimal energy, and system-level software management for low\\'power at hardware and OS level. We will also cover the state-of-the-art and the key techniques to design low-power integrated circuits and SoCs for wearable wireless systems. The hands\\'on lab of this module is focused on software techniques for the aforementioned topics. The main topic of the second module is entitled \\'communication\\': lectures will cover the main issues and challenges related to new protocols, management and optimization of communication for wearable wireless systems and networks. We will describe the essential concepts and transmission schemes behind current standards and introduce the basics of future emerging communication technologies and signaling schemes relevant to wireless sensor networks. The hands\\'on exercises related to this module will be focused on the several design trade\\'offs between high\\'level (like ZigBee) and low level protocols, as well as communication modeling around the body used as communication channel. The third module of the course is application-oriented lectures with focus on the actual needs in sport and clinics. It includes dedicated body worn sensors and signal processing, feature extraction and machine learning approaches, sensors fusion and data recording in wearable systems. The participants will have the opportunity to learn the state of the art and advances pervasive monitoring in heath and disease. The importance of outcome measures obtained through wearable systems and their validity is emphasized. Field measurement, daily activity recording as well as tools for analyzing long-term monitoring are presented through example in health and disease. The hands-on exercises of this module will cover practical issues about signal acquisition and software tuning and optimizations for physical mobility analyzing using wearable technology. Note The evaluation will be based on the correction of the exercises of the different modules and a final group project.\\xa0\\xa0 Keywords Wearable electronics, wireless body sensor networks, body communication, ultra-low power, system-level design, embedded systems, software optimization.\\xa0 Learning Prerequisites Recommended courses - \"Co-design of Systems-on-Chip on Reconfigurable Hardware\" - \"Microelectronics for Systems on Chips\" Important concepts to start the course - Architectures of microprogrammed enbedded systems - Communication protocols - Signal processing concepts - Advanced programming Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Implement complex embedded systems for wearable electronicsOptimize complete wearable systemsFormulate system level optimization problemsAssess / Evaluate different choices of communication and processing blocksJustify the global system performance Transversal skills Plan and carry out activities in a way which makes optimal use of available time and other resources.Assess one\\'s own level of skill acquisition, and plan their on-going learning goals.Use a work methodology appropriate to the task.

       "  'description': 'The book \"Solid Waste Engineering - A Global Perspective\" is the basis for this course. This textbook is an excellent introduction to the field of Solid Waste Engineering and gives insight into relevant solid waste treatment technologies and practices. Content With the third edition of Solid Waste Engineering, the authors have decided to expand this college textbook to focus on the worldwide problem of solid waste management. This change is illustrated by the addition of \\'A Global Perspective\\' to the title. Given that we are currently using our natural resources at an unsustainable rate, polluting our ocean and land with a variety of waste products and altering our atmosphere with gases that are causing further global warming, now is the time to educate future engineers with knowledge and tools to address these worldwide problems. The course is following the logic structure and the chapters of the book. The third edition has been rearranged to follow the hierarchy of solid waste management, reduce, reuse, recycle and recovery. Thus students will first learn about integrated waste management strategies, an expertise which will support the future engineer to take measures for pollution prevention as well as for resources conservation. In chapter 2 the students are introduced to municipal solid waste characteristics, including the identification of different waste components and materials. Component specific information is needed for recovery, separation and recycling of waste materials. The relevance of chemical, physical and mechanical properties are discussed in more detail as a basis for the chapters which follow. These properties are most helpful in order to identify potentially meaningful recycling pathways, as well as to decide about possible technological separation and purification options. The next chapter is dedicated to the collection of municipal solid waste, a key, but many times overlooked, component of integrated waste management. Following collection is mechanical processing, in most cases the necessary first step to the recycling and recovery of municipal solid waste. The students will then study mechanical, biological, and thermal processes. For each of these topics the authors have dedicated a separate chapter which will introduce the students to the basic principles of these separate disciplines in the context of waste management. Since not all waste streams can be recovered, students move on to residue management by combustion and landfilling. Finally students are exposed to the current issues in solid waste management and the principles of integrated and sustainable solid waste management. In a few cases the lectures at EPFL and the home reading will be complemented with field visits to waste treatment facilities. Keywords Waste Technologies, Recycling, Recovery, Secondary Resources, Mechanical Treatment, Thermal Treatment, Co-treatment, Landfilling, Residues, Stabilization, Heavy Metals, Biomass, Bioenergy, Technical Ordinance on Waste, Material and Elemental Flow Analysis Learning Prerequisites Required courses No specific course is required. For students without any chemistry background the class can be mastered but will be challenging. Recommended courses Environmental chemistry Analyse des polluants dans l\\'environnement Informatique pour l\\'ingénieur Numerical analysis Microbiologie pour l\\'ingénieur Communication pour l\\'ingénieur \\xa0 Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Characterize wastesAssess / Evaluate waste treatment pathwaysEstimate flows and quantities of waste and materialsJustify the choice of different waste treatment optionsPerform simple calculations to determine relevant parameters and process efficienciesTake into consideration measures for resources conservation and pollution prevention Transversal skills Respect relevant legal guidelines and ethical codes for the profession.Take account of the social and human dimensions of the engineering profession.Demonstrate a capacity for creativity.Demonstrate the capacity for critical thinkingMake an oral presentation.Communicate effectively with professionals from other disciplines.Write a scientific or technical report. Teaching methods The book \"Solid Waste Engineering\" is the basis for the course content which will be complemented with content from other sources (see \"further literature\" given below). Excursions and field visits (35%) will play a central role in studying and understanding process technologies.\\xa0 If possible the time of the visit will be set to best match with the learning content during the course. However, this is not always possible. Excursions and visits will take place according to the availability of the companies and experts. Due to the excursions less time for classic ex cathedra teaching is available and the amount of reading at home will be substantial. The students will be involved in further developing the content of the book Solid Waste Engineering. A focus will be on the improvement of existing and the suggestion of new exercises. This work will be performed in form of a group work. It will be presented to the class in form of an oral presentation and a written report. Presentations by the students (20%) will be integrated in the lecture time. The time for exercises will be used in a flexible way for own work, teamwork, and discussions. Normally every afternoon is representing a new and independent learning bloc related to a particular field or aspect of waste management or treatment technology (see content above). The course is taking place in the afternoon 2-5pm, however, some field excursions may take longer and at least for 1 excursion the travel to the field requires to leaving EPFL already at 1pm. The amount of field excursions at which a student is allowed to participate may be reduced in case the class is taken by more than 24 students. The time would be compensated by additional homework. Students who can participate in all joint activities and are ready to invest substantially in homework will appreciate this course. Expected student activities - Presence in the class and participation in discussions. - Participation at excursion(s). - Performing substantial reading and other work at home (the working load of 120h is high and corresponds to about a working day/week. This is including the lectures and excursions). Assessment methods 60% 4 short tests during the semester (only the 3 best marks will be considered). The examination dates will be announced at least 3 weeks ahead. The participation at 3 tests is mandatory. 20% Oral presentation. Design of an exercise which will be prepared and presented in form of a group work (date will be fixed two weeks ahead of the presentation) 20% Exercises and solutions which are ready to be enclosed in a future version of Solid Waste Engineering. This report is due one month after the oral presentation. Each student presents an own version of the exercise developed in the group.

       "  'description': \"The modern techniques and methods to measure snow properties in the field and in the laboratory are introduced by specialists in the corresponding field. The methods are applied in the field and in the laboratory and a report prepared using the measured data. Content Objectives The cryosphere forms an integral part of the climate system of the Earth. Measuring the properties of the seasonal and perennial snow cover properties is therefore essential in understanding interactions and feedback mechanisms related to the cryosphere. Snow is an extremely complex and highly variable medium, and all essential properties of seasonal snow cover are challenging to measure. Diverse fields such as hydrology, climatology, avalanche forecasting and Earth Observation from space benefit from improved quantification of snow cover properties, in particular related to the snow microstructure. The past 10 years snow science has seen a rapid change from a semi-quantitative to a quantitative science. Understanding physical and chemical processes in the snowpack requires detailed measurements of the microstructure. The Snow Science Winter School will teach these advanced techniques, as micro-tomography, measurement of specific surface area by reflection and spectroscopy, near-infrared photography and high-resolution penetrometry. The laboratory measurements (micro-CT, thin section, fabric analysis) will take place in Davos. Every other year the course takes places in Northern Finland (Sodankylä), with the focus on field methods and the arctic snowpack. \\xa0 Target audience Any graduate student or post-doc working on snow or in some snow related field is welcome to participate. Those fields include Glaciology, Hydrology, Oceanography, Geography, but also Biology or Chemistry as well as Engineering or Material Sciences. \\xa0 Course structure The focus of this workshop lies on field and laboratory measurements, combined with theoretical lessons in the classroom. Obligatory reading is provided about one month before the workshop, and will be examined during the school. Field and laboratory measurements will be done in small groups of 3-4 students.

A key concern of managers is the complex and uncertain relationship between the firm, its strategy, its performance and its environment. You study competition from the perspective of top management. Content What is strategy? And why are some firms more successful than others? \\xa0 These are the two key questions this course will give answers to, within a busienss context. This course is designed to study competition from the perspective of top management. A principal concern of managers is the relationship between a company, its strategy, its environment and the firm's performance. This relationship is complex, uncertain, and always changing. Top managers shape and guide this relationship, making strategic decisions that change the organization's capabilities, shift its position in the environment, or lead the firm into a new business. Consequently, this course has been designed to introduce students to the different aspects of strategic decision-making. For the most part, we will tackle the complexity and ambiguity of strategic decision making through discussions of case studies that provide rich descriptions of situations that are faced by real companies that either fail or succeed. In addition, various external speakers (company representatives) will discuss their company's strategy and challenges with you. In class, I will act as moderator, questioner, and lecturer to help you gain a better understanding of firms' strategy, their formulation, and implementation. By actively participating in class discussions, you will sharpen your own insights, and those of your classmates. Keywords corporate strategy, business strategy, competitive advantage, firm performance Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Examine concepts, models, and tools of strategic analysisAnalyze concepts and tools of strategic thinking to identify cause-effect relationshipsSynthesize firm level information and facts to support or reject cause-effect relationshipsAssess / Evaluate firm level corporate and business strategies of real firms Transversal skills Resolve conflicts in ways that are productive for the task and the people concerned.Keep appropriate documentation for group meetings.Access and evaluate appropriate sources of information.Summarize an article or a technical report.Make an oral presentation.Give feedback (critique) in an appropriate fashion.Evaluate one's own performance in the team, receive and respond appropriately to feedback.Communicate effectively, being understood, including across different languages and cultures.Identify the different roles that are involved in well-functioning teams and assume different roles, including leadership roles.Take feedback (critique) and respond in an appropriate manner.Write a scientific or technical report.Demonstrate the capacity for critical thinking Teaching methods Reading and discussion of key theoretical frameworks; Group work: in and outside class; Case discussions; Guest lectures & discussions with company representatives.

The course introduces the crystallographic tools required to define, calculate and predict the different configurations of variants. Content Many alloys, ceramics and nanomaterials are constituted of a fine microstructure created by structural phase transformations: nano-precipitates in aluminium or other alloys, laths of martensitic steels, basket-weave morphologies in titanium or zirconium alloys, twinned martensite in shape memory alloys, oriented domains in ferroelectrics, multiple twins in some metallic or silicon nanowires etc. The small size and complex intricacy of the domains give to the materials their unique mechanical and physical properties. A branch of materials science aims at improving these properties by studying the influence of some element additions and some modifications of elaboration process parameters. For these studies, a good understanding of the formation of the crystallographic domains is required: How can the domains be mathematically defined and computed? Why do they adopt such complex fine morphologies? Is it possible to extract information on the parent phase from a completely transformed material? \\xa0 The aim of the course is to give the main elements of response: \\xa0 - The course will start by a global overview of the different microstructures resulting from a phase transformation in its broad meaning; which includes precipitation, order-disorder, twinning etc. - Simple notions of crystallography will be recalled: The crystal systems, the point and space groups, and the notions of holohedry will be shortly explained (or reminded). - Matrix calculations in direct and reciprocal space will be explained: structure, metric, correspondence and other transformation matrices will be detailed. The notion of coincidence site latice (CSL) and special grain boundries will be treated. - The geometrical notions of global/local symmetries and the related algebraic concepts of groups and actions of groups will be introduced with simple geometric examples. It will be shown that a generalized structure derived from groups, called groupoid, can catch the fascinating complexity of the variants. - Some characteristics such as hysteresis, reversibility, transformation plasticity will be considered in direct link with some crystallographic properties such as group/subgroup relation, lattice compatibilities etc. - These theoretical concepts will be applied to specific materials (precipitation in aluminium, martensite in steels, multiple twinning in copper) correlated to industrial problems. It will be shown how groupoids can be used to reconstruct the prior parent grains and quantify variant selection mechanisms. - Finally, brief examples will be taken from literature to show that groupoids are well adapted to treat many symmetry-related problems in physics, chemistry and biology. \\xa0 This course is intended for students or researchers in materials science.

Computer simulations are used to explore examples of cellular processes illustrating these principles. Content This course aims to show students how the physical principles of conservation, symmetry and locality influence the dynamics of living organisms at the molecular and cellular level. We start with simple equations that embody a physical principle and compare them with experiments on cells or model systems. The importance of the local environment on dynamics at the molecular scale is introduced, and its influence on typical molecular-scale motions explored, including particle diffusion, the forces between particles in various media, and self-assembly of molecules into larger aggregates. Symmetric and asymmetric random processes are explored in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, and the combined effects of symmetry, in the sense of invariance under an operation, and mass conservation, or the re-use of a limited amount of matter, are shown to constrain how molecular aggregates assemble, stabilise or disassemble. Computer simulations of simple model systems are used as examples for exploration in problems and a semester project. The primary goal of the course is to show students how nature takes advantage of symmetry and conservation, or selectively breaks them, to achieve specific cellular goals, and to understand how computer simulations can be used to study these processes.

First, we cover new preferences: recursive utility, habit formation, uncertainty aversion. Then, we investigate incomplete markets, trading frictions, and heterogeneous agent models.

The phenomenon of biomineralization is relevant to the Earth, Environmental and Life Sciences on practically all length scales. From the immense scale of reef-systems and global ocean life-cycles to small bacterial communities, the impact of biominera\\xadliza\\xadtion spans length scales of at least 12 orders of magnitude and a large fraction of geological time! But despite the global environmental impact of biomineralization and its funda\\xadmental scien\\xadti\\xadfic importance, there are still many open questions about the basic biological mecha\\xadnisms involved. This class aims at giving the student an insight into the study of fundamental biological processes that shape biominerals and determine their chemical and isotopic composition.

       "  'description': \"This course introduces contemporary research findings in the teaching and learning of science and technology subjects in higher education, develops participants' teaching skills, and provides a framework for on-going development of their skills through evaluation of their own teaching practices. Content There have now been multiple reviews of the implication of learning sciences research for teaching. While it is impossible to distil such a rich body of work into a few catchphrases, certain key features do emerge: 1. Learning is an effortful process, which requires the student to process information or to practice using skills. The goal of teaching therefore, is to facilitate student work. This implies trying to avoid learning situations where students are mentally passive (e.g. the traditional frontal lecture). 2. Students and pupils learn best when goals are clear, and when they get feedback on how well they are meeting those goals and how they can improve. In higher education the use of techniques like student response systems ('clickers'), on-line quizzes, and mid-term tests, can maximize ongoing feedback to students. Peer evaluation and grading rubrics can be used to help to clarify learning goals. 3. People learn best in emotionally secure environments in which they can try, make mistakes, and get feedback without being made to feel inadequate or ridiculed. There is also evidence that, in higher education, in classes experienced as emotionally safe by teachers, their teaching approaches become more student-centered and less focused on simply `transmission of information'.\\xa0 4. Students learn best when they get to revise material over time. In particular, periodic low-stakes testing, and practiced recall have been found to have strong positive impacts on learning. In university contexts, where courses typically continue to introduce new material each week, mid-term tests and self-assessment quizzes can play an important role in ensuring long-term learning. 5. Students who are taught how to independently plan, monitor, de-bug and review their own learning, on average, outperform students who are not educated in such metacognitive regulation strategies. Students can be helped to develop this independence through the provision of clear learning goals, self-assessment activities, opportunities to review their own learning and chances to discuss their learning strategies with other students. While these issues apply across teaching and learning of all disciplines, specific isues arise in teaching science and engineering.\\xa0 The epistemologies of natural science disciplines are distinct from those in humanities and social sciences and these require teaching methods appropriate to these goals (such as, for example, inquiry-based methods, mathematical modelling of physical phenomena etc.).\\xa0 Engineering disciplines also have specific features such as the need to transfer analytical skills learned in classrooms into practice situations, and the key role of enginering design.\\xa0 Teaching science and engineering, therefore, requires pedagogies which are distinctive as well as evidence-informed. The goals of this course are: (a)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To introduce novice teachers in higher education (doctoral teaching asistants) to these contemporary research-informed approaches to teaching (b)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To provide opportunities for novice teachers to practice these skills (c)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To provide a framework within which novice teachers can adopt research-informed strategies in practice, and can evaluate the impact of such strategies as part of a process of continual self-development. The course is organised in four parts: (a) lectures on research on teaching and learning in higher education (8 hours of class), (b) reading of research evidence on teaching and learning (9 hours of independent student work) (c) skills workshops in which participants can practice and get feedback (8 hours in class) and (d) the implementation of research-informed teaching approaches in a course on which the participant works, and the evaluation of this intervention (25 hours independent work). This course focuses on the teaching and learning of science and engineering in higher education and does not lead to a recognized teaching qualification for primary or post-primary schools. \\xa0 LEARNING OUTCOMES By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Evaluate up-to-date developments in learning sciences related to teaching and learning of science and engineering in higher education; Demonstrate skills in presenting for learning, in tutoring and in giving students feedback; Apply this knowledge to their own teaching practice through the design of a teaching input Improve their own practice through systematically evaluating their own teaching input Timetable Tuesday 20th September: 9.15 ' 13h00 (Lectures ' group of 25) Tuesday 27th September: 9h15 -13h00 (Workshops ' groups of 8, 8 and 9) Tuesday 4th October: 9h15 ' 13h00 (Lectures' group of 25) Tuesday 11th October: 9h15 ' 13h00 (Workshops' groups of 8, 8 and 9) Tuesday 8th October: 9h15 ' 11h00 (Written Exam ' needs space for 50) & 11h00 ' 13h00 (Meeting with CAPE project supervisor) Submission of project report: 13th January 2017 Note Participants must be a teacher/tutor/ teaching assistant on an EPFL course at the time of undertaking this course Registration via IS-Academia Portal (maximum attendees: 24) Keywords Teaching and Learning Science and EngineeringResearch and Development of Teaching Practices Assessment methods The course is assessed through a written exam covering parts (a) and (b) and a project report integrating learing from parts (a) to (d).\",\n",

Content Science, Technology and Society -- in short STS -- studies the interrelations between these three elements. In particular, STS looks at how economic, social, political and cultural conditions shape science and technology and how, in turn, science and technology shape society. STS has evolved over time and this evolution will be reflected in the course: from a purely historical approach in the early 1960s showing how technology emerged in particular societal contexts, STS focused as of the second half of the 1960s on philosophical and epistomological questions (e.g., scientific revolutions as taking place in a societal context). In the context of the social movements of the late 1960s, STS opened up to other disciplines such as sociology, anthropology and political science. More recently, STS focused more on helping scientists and engineers understand the social and political contexts in which their knowledge and technologies come to be applied. This course offers a broad introduction to the field of STS studies, by placing science and technology within their different historical and societal contexts and this from the perspective of how STS has itself evolved over time.

       "  'description': \"During this summer school, participants will discover novel robotics assessment technologies and adaptive therapies including robot-assisted rehabilitation for different types of impairments, and will get clinical guidelines to design innovative robotic rehabiliation devices. Content The TRCR Summer School aims to strengthen the collaboration between engineers and clinicians for the development of novel technological tools and therapeutic plans that are able to answer patients' and clinicians' needs and improve their quality of life. Engineers and clinicians need to develop a common language and work side by side from the very early stages of the design of new technological tools all the way to their application in clinical settings. Bridging the technical knowledge with medical knowledge would allow to explore new solutions in technology-assisted rehabilitation. The school will focus on three complementary topics, each of which will be examined both from the clinical and the engineering perspective: T1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Clinical and robotic assessments: two complementary domains.Robotic devices could potentially provide quantitative and objective information on the patient's performance. However, robotic assessments are still at an infant stage and it is not clear how their outcomes should be interpreted to describe the patient's status and adapt the therapy to the individual. In this topic, we focus on how the currently available and well established clinical measures can take advantage of robots to gain accuracy and repeatability. T2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 From assessment to therapy: shaping a personalized therapy planConventional physical therapy and existing technological devices enable diversified therapeutic approaches. Nevertheless, this opportunity is often not fully exploited as it is not clear which are the therapy parameters (e.g., intensity, type of task) that maximize the recovery of the individual patient based on relevant clinical information. Clinicians and engineers should decide how to combine traditional physical therapy and technology to generate novel therapy plans. T3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Patient/therapist-oriented design of robots for rehabilitation and assistanceRobotic therapy and assistance involve physical interaction between the patient and the robot, and must thus consider both human factors, as well as adapted mechanical designs, actuation and advanced interaction control. Developments should be driven by clinical needs, and address the specific impairments of the individual patient. Note This summer school is jointly organized with ETHZ PhD students.

This course will focus on two major topics related to development: humanitarianism and public health. By humanitarianism, we refer to benevolent deeds undertaken beyond national frontiers on behalf of individuals, communities, groups or entire nations in dire straits by a variety of actors (i.e. organizations governmental and non-governmental associations, philanthropic foundations). The course will focus on humanitarian and public health's actors (non governmental organizations such as Médecins sans Frontière; international organizations; philanthropic organizations, for example the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). We will invite some of these actors and visit some of these institutions. We will also study these actors' tools, such as photography, movie, mass campaign vaccinations. We will pay attention to conflict and post conflict, imperial/colonial and post-colonial periods, during which development became a politically, economically, and socially relevant international issue. The course draws attention to the importance of historical perspectives, showing that global health or humanitarian operations are not inventions of the post-Cold War period but have a longer history. Our aim is to show continuities and ruptures between then and now. Case studies will be favoured in this class. The emphasis will also be put on extra-European countries.

The course introduces the crystallographic tools required to define, calculate and predict the different configurations of variants. Content Many alloys, ceramics and nanomaterials are constituted of a fine microstructure created by structural phase transformations: nano-precipitates in aluminium or other alloys, laths of martensitic steels, basket-weave morphologies in titanium or zirconium alloys, twinned martensite in shape memory alloys, oriented domains in ferroelectrics, multiple twins in some metallic or silicon nanowires etc. The small size and complex intricacy of the domains give to the materials their unique mechanical and physical properties. A branch of materials science aims at improving these properties by studying the influence of some element additions and some modifications of elaboration process parameters. For these studies, a good understanding of the formation of the crystallographic domains is required: How can the domains be mathematically defined and computed? Why do they adopt such complex fine morphologies? Is it possible to extract information on the parent phase from a completely transformed material? \\xa0 The aim of the course is to give the main elements of response: \\xa0 - The course will start by a global overview of the different microstructures resulting from a phase transformation in its broad meaning; which includes precipitation, order-disorder, twinning etc. - Simple notions of crystallography will be recalled: The crystal systems, the point and space groups, and the notions of holohedry will be shortly explained (or reminded). - Matrix calculations in direct and reciprocal space will be explained: structure, metric, correspondence and other transformation matrices will be detailed. The notion of coincidence site latice (CSL) and special grain boundries will be treated. - The geometrical notions of global/local symmetries and the related algebraic concepts of groups and actions of groups will be introduced with simple geometric examples. It will be shown that a generalized structure derived from groups, called groupoid, can catch the fascinating complexity of the variants. - Some characteristics such as hysteresis, reversibility, transformation plasticity will be considered in direct link with some crystallographic properties such as group/subgroup relation, lattice compatibilities etc. - These theoretical concepts will be applied to specific materials (precipitation in aluminium, martensite in steels, multiple twinning in copper) correlated to industrial problems. It will be shown how groupoids can be used to reconstruct the prior parent grains and quantify variant selection mechanisms. - Finally, brief examples will be taken from literature to show that groupoids are well adapted to treat many symmetry-related problems in physics, chemistry and biology. \\xa0 This course is intended for students or researchers in materials science.

Computer simulations are used to explore examples of cellular processes illustrating these principles. Content This course aims to show students how the physical principles of conservation, symmetry and locality influence the dynamics of living organisms at the molecular and cellular level. We start with simple equations that embody a physical principle and compare them with experiments on cells or model systems. The importance of the local environment on dynamics at the molecular scale is introduced, and its influence on typical molecular-scale motions explored, including particle diffusion, the forces between particles in various media, and self-assembly of molecules into larger aggregates. Symmetric and asymmetric random processes are explored in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, and the combined effects of symmetry, in the sense of invariance under an operation, and mass conservation, or the re-use of a limited amount of matter, are shown to constrain how molecular aggregates assemble, stabilise or disassemble. Computer simulations of simple model systems are used as examples for exploration in problems and a semester project. The primary goal of the course is to show students how nature takes advantage of symmetry and conservation, or selectively breaks them, to achieve specific cellular goals, and to understand how computer simulations can be used to study these processes.

Content 'Coupling' is a many-valued term in mathematical science! In a probabilist's vocabulary it means: finding out about a random system X by constructing a second random system Y on the same probability space (maybe augmented by a seasoning of extra randomness). Careful construction, choosing the right system Y, and designing the right kind of dependence between X and Y, leads to clear intuitive explanations of important facts about X, as well as enabling rather remarkable methods of exact simulation (so-called Coupling from the Past or CFTP). These lectures aim to survey ideas from coupling theory, using a pattern of beginning with an intuitive example, developing the idea of the example, and then remarking on further ramifications of the theory. \\xa0 Topic titles as follows: Coupling and (1) Monotonicity, (2) Representation, (3) Approximation, (4) Mixing; (5) A Coupling Zoo; (6) Classic CFTP; (7) Further topics in CFTP; (8) CFTP in applied probability.

What are the differences between how we learn (a) in initial training, (b) during the transition into work and (c) when an experienced professional?

Content The TRCR Summer School aims to strengthen the collaboration between engineers and clinicians for the development of novel technological tools and therapeutic plans that are able to answer patients' and clinicians' needs and improve their quality of life. Engineers and clinicians need to develop a common language and work side by side from the very early stages of the design of new technological tools all the way to their application in clinical settings. Bridging the technical knowledge with medical knowledge would allow to explore new solutions in technology-assisted rehabilitation. The school will focus on three complementary topics, each of which will be examined both from the clinical and the engineering perspective: T1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Clinical and robotic assessments: two complementary domains.Robotic devices could potentially provide quantitative and objective information on the patient's performance. However, robotic assessments are still at an infant stage and it is not clear how their outcomes should be interpreted to describe the patient's status and adapt the therapy to the individual. In this topic, we focus on how the currently available and well established clinical measures can take advantage of robots to gain accuracy and repeatability. T2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 From assessment to therapy: shaping a personalized therapy planConventional physical therapy and existing technological devices enable diversified therapeutic approaches. Nevertheless, this opportunity is often not fully exploited as it is not clear which are the therapy parameters (e.g., intensity, type of task) that maximize the recovery of the individual patient based on relevant clinical information. Clinicians and engineers should decide how to combine traditional physical therapy and technology to generate novel therapy plans. T3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Patient/therapist-oriented design of robots for rehabilitation and assistanceRobotic therapy and assistance involve physical interaction between the patient and the robot, and must thus consider both human factors, as well as adapted mechanical designs, actuation and advanced interaction control. Developments should be driven by clinical needs, and address the specific impairments of the individual patient. Note This summer school is jointly organized with ETHZ PhD students.

       "  'description': \"This course introduces contemporary research findings in the teaching and learning of science and technology subjects in higher education, develops participants' teaching skills, and provides a framework for on-going development of their skills through evaluation of their own teaching practices. Content There have now been multiple reviews of the implication of learning sciences research for teaching. While it is impossible to distil such a rich body of work into a few catchphrases, certain key features do emerge: 1. Learning is an effortful process, which requires the student to process information or to practice using skills. The goal of teaching therefore, is to facilitate student work. This implies trying to avoid learning situations where students are mentally passive (e.g. the traditional frontal lecture). 2. Students and pupils learn best when goals are clear, and when they get feedback on how well they are meeting those goals and how they can improve. In higher education the use of techniques like student response systems ('clickers'), on-line quizzes, and mid-term tests, can maximize ongoing feedback to students. Peer evaluation and grading rubrics can be used to help to clarify learning goals. 3. People learn best in emotionally secure environments in which they can try, make mistakes, and get feedback without being made to feel inadequate or ridiculed. There is also evidence that, in higher education, in classes experienced as emotionally safe by teachers, their teaching approaches become more student-centered and less focused on simply `transmission of information'.\\xa0 4. Students learn best when they get to revise material over time. In particular, periodic low-stakes testing, and practiced recall have been found to have strong positive impacts on learning. In university contexts, where courses typically continue to introduce new material each week, mid-term tests and self-assessment quizzes can play an important role in ensuring long-term learning. 5. Students who are taught how to independently plan, monitor, de-bug and review their own learning, on average, outperform students who are not educated in such metacognitive regulation strategies. Students can be helped to develop this independence through the provision of clear learning goals, self-assessment activities, opportunities to review their own learning and chances to discuss their learning strategies with other students. While these issues apply across teaching and learning of all disciplines, specific isues arise in teaching science and engineering.\\xa0 The epistemologies of natural science disciplines are distinct from those in humanities and social sciences and these require teaching methods appropriate to these goals (such as, for example, inquiry-based methods, mathematical modelling of physical phenomena etc.).\\xa0 Engineering disciplines also have specific features such as the need to transfer analytical skills learned in classrooms into practice situations, and the key role of enginering design.\\xa0 Teaching science and engineering, therefore, requires pedagogies which are distinctive as well as evidence-informed. The goals of this course are: (a)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To introduce novice teachers in higher education (doctoral teaching asistants) to these contemporary research-informed approaches to teaching (b)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To provide opportunities for novice teachers to practice these skills (c)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To provide a framework within which novice teachers can adopt research-informed strategies in practice, and can evaluate the impact of such strategies as part of a process of continual self-development. The course is organised in four parts: (a) lectures on research on teaching and learning in higher education (8 hours of class), (b) reading of research evidence on teaching and learning (9 hours of independent student work) (c) skills workshops in which participants can practice and get feedback (8 hours in class) and (d) the implementation of research-informed teaching approaches in a course on which the participant works, and the evaluation of this intervention (25 hours independent work). This course focuses on the teaching and learning of science and engineering in higher education and does not lead to a recognized teaching qualification for primary or post-primary schools. \\xa0 LEARNING OUTCOMES By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Evaluate up-to-date developments in learning sciences related to teaching and learning of science and engineering in higher education; Demonstrate skills in presenting for learning, in tutoring and in giving students feedback; Apply this knowledge to their own teaching practice through the design of a teaching input Improve their own practice through systematically evaluating their own teaching input Timetable Tuesday 20th September: 9.15 ' 13h00 (Lectures ' group of 25) Tuesday 27th September: 9h15 -13h00 (Workshops ' groups of 8, 8 and 9) Tuesday 4th October: 9h15 ' 13h00 (Lectures' group of 25) Tuesday 11th October: 9h15 ' 13h00 (Workshops' groups of 8, 8 and 9) Tuesday 8th October: 9h15 ' 11h00 (Written Exam ' needs space for 50) & 11h00 ' 13h00 (Meeting with CAPE project supervisor) Submission of project report: 13th January 2017 Note Participants must be a teacher/tutor/ teaching assistant on an EPFL course at the time of undertaking this course Registration via IS-Academia Portal (maximum attendees: 24) Keywords Teaching and Learning Science and EngineeringResearch and Development of Teaching Practices Assessment methods The course is assessed through a written exam covering parts (a) and (b) and a project report integrating learing from parts (a) to (d).\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This studio explores meaningful form generating processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools and introduces the notion of growth typologies. Our studio site will be in Singapore, our programme the procedural design of an innovation building prototypology. Content The advent of new digital technologies has had a twofold impact on architectural thinking and urban design, transforming, on one hand, the processes for form generation and design production through algorithmic and parametric technologies, and, on the other hand, enabling an escape from the static fate of the built environment by facilitating dynamic interaction between inhabitants and their surrounding. Our interest in the orientation \\'Artificial Morphogenesis\\' is to explore meaningful form generating processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools and introduce the notion of growth typologies in architectural and urban design thinking. In particular, we examine the potential of responsive morphogenetic design to explore intuitive form finding processes that address bio-climatic and socio-economic challenges. This studio (the \"Singapore studio\") is the second in a planned series of design research projects focused on the theme of data-driven architectural design. While developing a base of digital evidence specific to each site, each studio will explore novel means of deploying this data to support design and generate form. The intellectual aim of the studio is to question the extent to which the data-scape can artificially generate urban form. Our interest is directed at the decoding and recoding of two distinct domains of knowledge: exteriority which represents a many-layered geographic condition and anteriority which represents the embedded knowledge of local architectural typologies and systems. While the exteriority of geographic data is crucial to our research, we place a primary emphasis on the generative potential of typology- what we have called \"growth typologies\". Decoding anterior form and then recoding and deploying it across new territories allows us to challenge the role of architecture in urban developments of increased scale and complexity.\\xa0 \\xa0 Keywords \\' Data-driven Design \\' Parametricism \\' Morphogenesis \\' Artificial Design \\' Tropical Architecture \\' Singapore \\' Climate and Form\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Learning Prerequisites Required courses N/A Recommended courses AR-401(Y) Théorie et critique du projet MA1 (Huang). Important concepts to start the course (1) Parametric Methods: In alignment with the goals of the morphogenesis orientation, this studio will explore meaningful form generating processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools and introduce the notion of growth typologies in architectural and urban design thinking. (2) Digital Generative Design Tools: We assert that it is precisely the new wave of digital tools (scripting, parametric modeling, and associative geometry) that enable the type of approach which is forwarded by the studio\\'s agenda. The ability to organize and leverage information permits the architect to approach projects of new scales and complexity. The logical management of variation allows the architect to avoid repetitive solutions and to maintain an equally high level of conceptual rigor across the entire project, to engage with that complexity rather than reducing it. An additional aspect is the ability to quickly and accurately produce quantitative information during the design process which can be used to strengthen the argument or inform the decision-making process.\\xa0 \\xa0 Learning Outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to: Interpret the morphogenetic parameters and other issues of relevance to the project using drawings and diagrams.Critique a specific project brief and a specific context and respond with a meaningful data-driven design concept.Translate a data-driven design concept into meaningful architectural propositions at appropriate scales and levels of granularity.Produce coherent architectural representations and models at sufficient levels of detail.Formulate the morphogenetic narrative and create convincing arguments for the design propositions.Develop convincing final diagrams, drawings, renderings, simulations, physical and digital models.

In this context, it also describes key links between signal processing, linear algebra, statistics and artificial neural networks. Content 1. Introduction: Statistical (static and dynamic) pattern recognition, temporal pattern recognition problems, etc2. Basic tools in temporal pattern modeling: Correlation, autocorrelation, linear/nonlinear AR, ARMA and ARCH modeling3. Statistical pattern recognition: Bayes classifiers, artificial neural networks (ANNs), discriminant functions, Expectation-Maximization algorithm, dynamic programming4. Sequence processing: discrete Markov models, hidden Markov models (HMM), autoregressive (AR)-HMM, hybrid HMM/ANN systems, parameter estimation (EM and forward-backward algorithms applied to these models)5. Laboratory exercises: in statistical pattern recognition, autoregressive modeling, Markov models and hidden Markov models Note Course notes (and relevant book chapters) available: Keywords Statistical modeling, Markov models, hidden Markov models, artificial neural networks for sequence processing. Learning Prerequisites Recommended courses Undergraduate level statistics, linear algebra (matric computations, up to PCA) and minimum knowledge/interest in signal processing and machine learning.
